📈 Stock Data Viewer – Streamlit App

This project is a simple Stock Data Viewer web application built using Streamlit and yfinance. The app allows users to fetch and visualize historical stock market data in an interactive way.

The main goal of this project was to practice building data-driven web apps using Python and to understand how real-world financial data can be fetched and visualized.

🔍 What the App Does
Take a stock ticker symbol as input (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
Allows users to select a start date and an end date
Executes the data fetch only after clicking a button
Fetches historical stock data using the yfinance library

Displays:
Stock data in a table
Line chart of closing prices
Line chart of daily trading volume

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit – for building the web interface
yfinance – for fetching stock market data
Pandas – for data handling and processing
Streamlit charts / Plotly – for data visualization

🎯 Purpose of This Project
This project was created as part of my learning journey in Data Analytics and AI.
It helped me understand:
How Streamlit works for creating interactive apps
Handling user inputs and button-based execution
Working with APIs to fetch real-world data
Visualizing time-series data effectively

🚀 How to Run the App
Install the required libraries:
pip install streamlit yfinance pandas

Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

Open the app in your browser, enter the details, and explore the data.

📌 Notes
Make sure you enter a valid stock ticker symbol
Start date should be earlier than the end date
The app is intended for learning and educational purposes

🙌 Feedback
Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome.
This is a beginner project, and I plan to keep improving it as I learn more.
